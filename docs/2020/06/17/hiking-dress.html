<meta name="description" content="I wanted to make a dress for a friend that is too tall and broad-shouldered for most dresses– furthermore, I wanted the material to be good for hiking: light, quickdrying, and breathable. Apparently taslanated nylon is a material with these properties, commonly used to make various outdoor clothing. I turned a sewing guide for a simple A-line dress into an R script that builds a dress pattern from 3 simple body measurements. After inputing height, bust, and shoulder measurements, the program (which you can access/use here) produces something like this: This can then be mapped onto parchment paper and cut out to form a pattern: After cutting out the material from the patterns, I sewed the top of the shoulders, and down the sides of the dress, and added bias tape to the neckline and arm holes. I finished by hemming the bottom to the desired height." />

    <p>I wanted to make a dress for a friend that is too tall and broad-shouldered for most dresses– furthermore, I wanted the material to be good for hiking: light, quickdrying, and breathable.

This can then be mapped onto parchment paper and cut out to form a pattern:

After cutting out the material from the patterns, I sewed the top of the shoulders, and down the sides of the dress, and added <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_tape" target="_blank">bias tape</a> to the neckline and arm holes. I finished by hemming the bottom to the desired height.</p>
